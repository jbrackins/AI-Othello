<p>Othello, also known as Reversi, is a game played on an 8x8 grid with 64 discs 
that are black on one side and white on the other. Based on the following 
start position:</p>

<pre><code>- - - - - - - -
- - - - - - - - 
- - - - - - - - 
- - - W B - - - 
- - - B W - - - 
- - - - - - - - 
- - - - - - - - 
- - - - - - - - 
</code></pre>

<p>the two players (BLACK and WHITE) alternate turns placing discs on the board. 
In order for a valid turn to be made, discs must be placed to surround enemy 
pieces. Whenever a row, column, or diagonal of contiguous white pieces are 
surrounded on both ends by black pieces, the white pieces are "flipped" to the 
black side, making them black piecs. ( The opposite applies for flipping to 
white pieces, naturally. ) This is referred to as "flanking", or "bracketing".</p>

<p>In the following demonstration, The black player moves first, places a disc in 
row 6, column 5. This causes the white disc in row 5, column 5 to flip to the 
black side.</p>

<pre><code>- - - - - - - -     - - - - - - - -     - - - - - - - - 
- - - - - - - -     - - - - - - - -     - - - - - - - - 
- - - - - - - -     - - - - - - - -     - - - - - - - - 
- - - W B - - -  =&gt; - - - W B - - -  =&gt; - - - W B - - - 
- - - B W - - -  =&gt; - - - B W - - -  =&gt; - - - B B - - -  
- - - - - - - -     - - - - B - - -     - - - - B - - - 
- - - - - - - -     - - - - - - - -     - - - - - - - - 
- - - - - - - -     - - - - - - - -     - - - - - - - - 
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever a player cannot place a disc that will bracket enemy pieces, that 
player must forfeit their current turn.</p>

<p>The game continues until either the board is filled, or once a scenario occurs 
in which neither player can perform a legal move. At this point, the number of 
discs are counted for each side and the player with the most discs is the
victor.</p>

<a id="program-description" class="anchor" href="#program-description" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Program Description</h1>

<p>For this project, a Lisp program has been implemented for the Othello game. 
There are options for human vs human, human vs ai, and ai vs ai. The AI 
implemented for this program is designed to investigate AI game playing 
techniques. In particular, this program uses the minimax strategy with 
alpha-beta pruning.</p>

<h1>
<a id="minimax" class="anchor" href="#minimax" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Minimax</h1>

<p>Minimax is an algorithm that works well for two-player board games, and exists 
as a model for making moves based on knowledge of what the other player will do. 
This algorithm opperates on the truism "What is good for my opponent is bad for 
me". The general idea of minimax is the 
following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Look at all available moves</li>
<li>Assign a rating to each board position that results form each move</li>
<li>Pick the move with the [minimum/maximum] point rating.</li>
</ol>

<p>This algorithm alternates step 3 for minimum and maximum for the player 
[maximum] and their opponent [minimum]. One of the benefits of this method is 
that the point ratings work for both the player moves and the opponent moves; 
alternating looking at minimum during opponent's turn and maximum during player 
turn is sufficient. Minimax is performed by creating a graph of available moves 
and performing depth-first search.</p>

<a id="alpha-beta-pruning" class="anchor" href="#alpha-beta-pruning" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Alpha-beta Pruning</h1>

<p>Alpha beta pruning is a search algorithm that decreases the number of nodes 
needed to be evaluated by the minimax algorithm. This algorithm stops 
evaluating a particular move when at least one possibility has been found 
that renders the move to be worse than a previously examined move available 
for the current player. As a result, the returned solution from minimax without 
alpha-beta pruning will be identical to the solution from minimax with 
alpha-beta pruning. The major difference is the amount of time saved by 
reducing the number of expanded nodes in the search algorithm.</p>

<a id="othello-tournament" class="anchor" href="#othello-tournament" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Othello Tournament</h1>

<p>For the Spring 2016 CSC 447/547 course, we are holding an Othello tournament 
in which our program will compete against the programs written by other 
students in the course. in order to facilitate the programs playing against one 
another, the following torunament functions have been supplied:</p>

<ul>
<li>( make-move position player ply ) </li>
</ul>

<p>This function takes the current board position, the current player who has the 
next move, and the depth of search (or ply, to look ahead in the game tree). 
It returns a ( row col ) list that specifies the move selected by the minimax 
function, or NIL if no legal move exists.</p>

<ul>
<li>( othello-init )</li>
</ul>

<p>Another tournament function is othello-init, which takes no arguments. This 
function is called once, prior to the start of tournament play. Initialization 
code may be placed in this routine if necessary, but our implementation does 
not use this function at all.</p>
