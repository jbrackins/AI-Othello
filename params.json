Based on the following \r\nstart position:\r\n\r\n    - - - - - - - -\r\n    - - - - - - - - \r\n    - - - - - - - - \r\n    - - - W B - - - \r\n    - - - B W - - - \r\n    - - - - - - - - \r\n    - - - - - - - - \r\n    - - - - - - - - \r\n\r\nthe two players (BLACK and WHITE) alternate turns placing discs on the board. \r\nIn order for a valid turn to be made, discs must be placed to surround enemy \r\npieces. Whenever a row, column, or diagonal of contiguous white pieces are \r\nsurrounded on both ends by black pieces, the white pieces are \"flipped\" to the \r\nblack side, making them black piecs. ( The opposite applies for flipping to \r\nwhite pieces, naturally. ) This is referred to as \"flanking\", or \"bracketing\".\r\n\r\nIn the following demonstration, The black player moves first, places a disc in \r\nrow 6, column 5. This causes the white disc in row 5, column 5 to flip to the \r\nblack side.\r\n\r\n    - - - - - - - -     - - - - - - - -     - - - - - - - - \r\n    - - - - - - - -     - - - - - - - -     - - - - - - - - \r\n    - - - - - - - -     - - - - - - - -     - - - - - - - - \r\n    - - - W B - - -  => - - - W B - - -  => - - - W B - - - \r\n    - - - B W - - -  => - - - B W - - -  => - - - B B - - -  \r\n    - - - - - - - -     - - - - B - - -     - - - - B - - - \r\n    - - - - - - - -     - - - - - - - -     - - - - - - - - \r\n    - - - - - - - -     - - - - - - - -     - - - - - - - - \r\n\r\nWhenever a player cannot place a disc that will bracket enemy pieces, that \r\nplayer must forfeit their current turn.\r\n\r\nThe game continues until either the board is filled, or once a scenario occurs \r\nin which neither player can perform a legal move. At this point, the number of \r\ndiscs are counted for each side and the player with the most discs is the\r\nvictor.\r\n\r\n# Program Description\r\nFor this project, a Lisp program has been implemented for the Othello game. \r\nThere are options for human vs human, human vs ai, and ai vs ai. The AI \r\nimplemented for this program is designed to investigate AI game playing \r\ntechniques. In particular, this program uses the minimax strategy with \r\nalpha-beta pruning.\r\n\r\n# Minimax\r\nMinimax is an algorithm that works well for two-player board games, and exists \r\nas a model for making moves based on knowledge of what the other player will do. \r\nThis algorithm opperates on the truism \"What is good for my opponent is bad for \r\nme\". The general idea of minimax is the \r\nfollowing:\r\n  1. Look at all available moves\r\n  2. Assign a rating to each board position that results form each move\r\n  3. Pick the move with the [minimum/maximum] point rating.\r\n\r\nThis algorithm alternates step 3 for minimum and maximum for the player \r\n[maximum] and their opponent [minimum]. One of the benefits of this method is \r\nthat the point ratings work for both the player moves and the opponent moves; \r\nalternating looking at minimum during opponent's turn and maximum during player \r\nturn is sufficient. Minimax is performed by creating a graph of available moves \r\nand performing depth-first search.\r\n\r\n( Minimax Description Source: Land of Lisp, Conrad Barski )\r\n\r\n# Alpha-beta Pruning\r\nAlpha beta pruning is a search algorithm that decreases the number of nodes \r\nneeded to be evaluated by the minimax algorithm. This algorithm stops \r\nevaluating a particular move when at least one possibility has been found \r\nthat renders the move to be worse than a previously examined move available \r\nfor the current player. As a result, the returned solution from minimax without \r\nalpha-beta pruning will be identical to the solution from minimax with \r\nalpha-beta pruning. The major difference is the amount of time saved by \r\nreducing the number of expanded nodes in the search algorithm.\r\n\r\n( Alpha-beta Pruning Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-beta_pruning )\r\n\r\n# Program Usage\r\n* Command Line Usage:\r\n    \r\n    clisp othello.lsp (player: Black or White)\r\n\r\n* CLISP Usage:\r\n\r\n    (load 'othello)\r\n\r\n    ( othello [player] )\r\n\r\n# Othello Tournament\r\nFor the Spring 2016 CSC 447/547 course, we are holding an Othello tournament \r\nin which our program will compete against the programs written by other \r\nstudents in the course. in order to facilitate the programs playing against one \r\nanother, the following torunament functions have been supplied:\r\n\r\n* ( make-move position player ply ) \r\n\r\nThis function takes the current board position, the current player who has the \r\nnext move, and the depth of search (or ply, to look ahead in the game tree). \r\nIt returns a ( row col ) list that specifies the move selected by the minimax \r\nfunction, or NIL if no legal move exists.\r\n\r\n* ( othello-init )\r\n\r\nAnother tournament function is othello-init, which takes no arguments. This \r\nfunction is called once, prior to the start of tournament play. Initialization \r\ncode may be placed in this routine if necessary, but our implementation does \r\nnot use this function at all.\r\n\r\n# References\r\nA fair bit of research was put into this program for learning the rules to \r\nOthello and gaining an understanding for implementing our strategies.
